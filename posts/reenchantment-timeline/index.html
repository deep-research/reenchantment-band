This lead to an intense interest in doom metal and black metal. Victor participated in a short lived rock band called Lamp. Victor started a band called Shroud of Delirium with David Sommer on drums. Aaron Schreiber became the bassist shortly afterwards by playing a middle eastern sounding scale that seemed very impressive at the time. The band mostly played doom metal songs with a black metal influence such as Follow the Light, The Ritual, and Hypnotics. They played live multiple times at at a hookah bar called Swingstate that is no longer in existence. Lamp band practice\nShroud of Delirium Animation by Kevin Auvinen\n2008 Shroud of Delirium entered a psychedelic period in 2008. Victor was into stoner movies like Dig!, Dazed \u0026 Confused and This Is How We Trip at the time. He also loved conspiracy documentaries on Google Video like Zeitgeist and America: Freedom to Fascism. Victor added lighter songs such as They’ll Come For You and Remember to the set. A short lived project called Jeff’s After School Special was formed. Shroud of Delirium live at Swingstate\nShroud of Delirium with Jeff Smith\n2009 Shroud of Delirium radically slowed down their tempos due to an increased interest in funeral doom and drone doom. They also became interested in spiritual practices such as meditation and ritual. The Commune\nShroud of Delirium reunion\n2010 Aaron visited a spiritual community in New Mexico called The Lama Foundation and eventually became their treasurer. Due to the fact that the band was starting to wane, Victor started a solo project called The Lord Reverend Wizard of Reverend of Despair. Victor also started a radio show called Reverend Radio on WMXM 88.9 FM Lake Forest College radio. The name was later changed to tReverend Radio with cohost DJ Dealer (Trevor Nykaza), and then subsequently Victor’s Astrology Hour. The Reverend of Despair photographed by Mary Ekern\nDJ Dealer of tReverend Radio\n2011 Victor became increasingly interested in the occult. Victor recorded an eclectic album called Spirit Writing. It had a pleasantly underground feel to it. 2012 Victor recorded an even more eclectic album called At the Edge of the World that had a much bigger and more polished sound. Here is a quote that was used to spread the malevolent influence of the album:\nWe, His Excellency The Lord Reverend Wizard of Alchemical Despair Himself! By the Grace of God, Emperor and Autocrat of All Underground Heavy Metal and Rock and Roll Music and the Most Feared D.J. on All Radio, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera Hereby Pronounce “At the Edge of the World” to be the Greatest Recording Ever Created For All Time With No Exception and Deem It Mandatory to Listen to This Record, For All Able Bodied Souls Within the Confines of The Reverend’s Magnificently Glorious and Eternal Empire.\nAaron depicted on the cover of Victor’s album.\nVictor depicted on the cover of Aaron’s song.\n2013 Aaron started a solo project called Pater Shrouder. Aaron and Victor completed a powerful and violent ritual known as The Night of Nine Rites. Pater Shrouder’s altar\n2014 Victor and Aaron collaborated on a strange and awesome project known as The 666 Names of Aleister Crowley. 2015 Victor graduated from Lake Forest College with a degree in music and religion.\n2016 Victor created controversial website called Right Wing Occultism that covered news about witchcraft from around the world. Although it generated traffic, it shut it down due to security concerns. Victor and Aaron were also involved with a mysterious occult group known as The Shadow Work Society. The Shadow Work Society\nThe Reverend of Despair is objectively evil.\n2017 Victor created a new version of his website called The Deep Research Archive . It was also occult themed. 2018 Victor began a formal study of computer programming and was able to create the first truly stable version of his website. It was called victorslibrary.com and was written with Wordpress.org. The recording quality for Victor’s music improved with recordings like They’ll Come For You, The Ritual, The Ceremony of Forgiveness, and Otherworldly Dream Magic. Victor debated whether his musical project should be called Strange People in Pain, The McKenna Method, or Reenchantment. He ended up settling on the latter. 2019 Victor became interested in information science to improve his research and cataloging abilities. He did a lot of writing and recording for the website. The main goal was to release demo versions of every song. 2020 Victor created a second stable version of his website called reenchantment.band. It was written in a more developer friendly framework called Gridsome. The code was more custom and had better performance, although he wasn’t able to continue the process due to problems with the architecture. Victor also started to work on recording demos to copyright all of his songs. 2021 Victor was able to finish copyrighting his songs. He also completed a major update of his musical equipment. 2022 Victor improved his video production quality. He decided to adopt a three pronged media strategy of music, blogging, and podcasting. He also started to develop a parapsychology laboratory.
