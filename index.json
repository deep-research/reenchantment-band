Kelvin of Forgotten Songs Spirit Writing album blue\nHere what the so-called Reverend of Despair (his real name is Victor Fisher and he\u0026rsquo;s from a band called Shroud of Delirium) wrote on Encyclopaedia Metallum to present this album: \u0026ldquo;I have been working on this new solo project due to the absence of my band. Although plagued by mediocre production (alternate: although blessed with obscure production) I thought this may interest some of you. It\u0026rsquo;s doom-based eclectic madness! Heavy music has done me plenty of good. Maybe if even a single odd fellow will enjoy this effort it was well worth it.\u0026rdquo;\nSo here is my answer. I\u0026rsquo;m among the ones to consider that this kind of production is a blessing and not a plague. Moreover I not only enjoy this effort, I consider it as one of the best surprises of the year, and I listen to quite a large amount of music in doom-sludge-black metal-atmospheric post rock and other experimental delirium. But here, I literally found in love with this unexpected mix of so much genres, styles and sounds that nobody had the idea to telescope. It\u0026rsquo;s Black Sabbath meeting Roky Erickson meeting Buzzcocks meeting whatever has some sense of melody in doomland and even Nikki Sudden. And the fact that there is a real feeling of artisanal humanity that flows from it make it not only a worth but a mandatory acquisition.\nThat\u0026rsquo;ll be my last word. Do some more in the future please, we need such albums in our dull lives. Here\u0026rsquo;s the Bandcamp. Here\u0026rsquo;s the album. Moreover his favorite citation is said to be \u0026ldquo;In heaven all the interesting people are missing.\u0026rdquo; from Nietzsche, and honestly, he\u0026rsquo;s right. And visiting his facebook page, it seems to be politically quite rough and citing Stalin and Proudhon, not common in this country. Support.\n2. Spirit Writing Album Review by Marcel H. of Lords of Metal Spirit Writing album grey\nWhat the flying f**k have I got here? Weird samples of spoken words that seem to be delivered by a rapper, electronic beats. What the hell does this have to do with doom? Yes, I know, a band name doesnt say a thing, but mister Reverend Of Despair himself describes his music as doom. I know that that isnt the be all and end all either (case in point Alexi Laiho who once said that Children Of Bodom played black metal) but the entire package screamed doom metal at me.\nAfter three totally alienating songs of which song number three asks How Enlightened Are You? (well, totally not at all it seems), we get The Grieg And Euphorization Revealed and lo and behold here is the doom that was promised, even though the heavily distorted vocals still make it as alienating as can be. And what the hell is A Plastic Paradise? Rap/funk doom? And it just keeps on going on like this on the entire album. Really, almost everything is fired at the listener even though it is clear that all the time its the same band/man/project. A song such as The Curse Of The Gothic Rainberries At Deaths Door (the song title alone is enough to make me scream) is doom once again. After having listened to this album about twenty times I am still not sure, this is pure genius or the biggest junk ever. It has been very long ago, if at all, that an album has left me behind this confused.\nCongratulations, mister Reverend Of Despair for achieving something extremely rare. That fact in itself deserves my fullest respect. Oh yeah, the last four songs are by Reverend Of Despairs full band Shroud Of Delirium but fit snugly with the rest of the songs featured here. Grading this work is an impossible task. My advice to everyone is, check this out for yourselves and lets see if you get just as confused as me.\n3. Demo 2019 Review by Ted Nubel of The Chicago Doom Confederacy Demo 2019\nStrange People In Pain is the latest project from a rather mysterious figure formerly known as \u0026ldquo;The Lord Reverend Wizard of Alchemical Despair\u0026rdquo;, or more colloquially, Victor Fisher. I first met Victor when he joined Sacred Monster as a vocalist for a few months, way before we even recorded our first EP. That didn\u0026rsquo;t work out due to time constraints, but in the short while that he was in the band, it was apparent that Victor was in a league of his own, musically and otherwise \u0026ndash; he operates on a different plane of existence than most of us mortals. That\u0026rsquo;s especially apparent with his latest project, \u0026ldquo;Strange People In Pain\u0026rdquo;, which he\u0026rsquo;s kicked off recently with a two-song demo that showcases the different aspects of the sound and its basis in philosophical musings.\nThe opener, \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;ll Come For You (Mermaid Version)\u0026rdquo;, is a relaxed atmospheric rock track, though the chord progressions feel rooted in 70\u0026rsquo;s rock (Jefferson Airplane, Fleetwood Mac particularly) to me, with obvious psychedelic influences. Victor and his co-conspirator Aaron Schreiber have created an extremely comforting vibe here even with some demo aspects in the sound \u0026ndash; programmed drums, some digital-feeling tones at points \u0026ndash; that\u0026rsquo;s relaxing to listen to. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of a juxtaposition with the depressing lyrical content, which lambasts the tendencies of modern society to restrict free will and education.\nOn the flip side is \u0026ldquo;The Ritual\u0026rdquo;, with a doomier sound closer to T.L.R.W.o.A.D.\u0026rsquo;s previous output. It feels almost like a black metal lens cast upon the atmospheric rock of the opening track, which averages out to a slow, evil and groovy affair with harsher vocals. Still present here are the 70s-feeling progressions and adept manipulation of melodies to craft something that\u0026rsquo;s far more than just a few riffs stapled together. So, think first-wave black metal riffs tied together with Black Sabbath trimmings and you\u0026rsquo;re getting there.\nVictor is not one for convention, which is why to listen to this demo in the intended order you\u0026rsquo;ll need to hit up the band website, where you can also check out the backstory on the band, which has been written in a sort of tongue-in-cheek historical retrospective tone.\nI end up running into Victor every couple of years \u0026ndash; sometimes physically, sometimes through email, and it\u0026rsquo;s always nice to see what he\u0026rsquo;s up to. Fun fact \u0026ndash; a while back he filled in on bass with Sacred Monster at a Mutiny show for a single cover of Black Sabbath\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Snowblind\u0026rdquo;, which also makes him, technically, a live member. I can\u0026rsquo;t really predict what he\u0026rsquo;ll be up to next, but make sure you listen to this latest iteration.\nYou can find the demo here:\nThey\u0026rsquo;ll Come For You The Ritual 4. The Ritual Song Review by DJ Prajmetal of She Likes It Heavy Radio Show She Likes It Heavy radio show\nVictor Fisher, aka The Lord Reverend Wizard of Alchemical Despair, aka the infamous Bruce\u0026rsquo;s Crain\u0026rsquo;s acquaintance is mostly a philosophizer that lends his wholly compelling and uniquely creepy vocal to a wonderfully emotionally-laden black metal. I listened to this on repeat.\nOriginal Post\n","permalink":"https://reenchantment.band/posts/reenchantment-reviews/","summary":"1. Spirit Writing Album Review by D.

This lead to an intense interest in doom metal and black metal. Victor participated in a short lived rock band called Lamp. Victor started a band called Shroud of Delirium with David Sommer on drums. Aaron Schreiber became the bassist shortly afterwards by playing a middle eastern sounding scale that seemed very impressive at the time. The band mostly played doom metal songs with a black metal influence such as Follow the Light, The Ritual, and Hypnotics. They played live multiple times at at a hookah bar called Swingstate that is no longer in existence. Lamp band practice\nShroud of Delirium Animation by Kevin Auvinen\n2008 Shroud of Delirium entered a psychedelic period in 2008. Victor was into stoner movies like Dig!, Dazed \u0026amp; Confused and This Is How We Trip at the time. He also loved conspiracy documentaries on Google Video like Zeitgeist and America: Freedom to Fascism. Victor added lighter songs such as They\u0026rsquo;ll Come For You and Remember to the set. A short lived project called Jeff\u0026rsquo;s After School Special was formed. Shroud of Delirium live at Swingstate\nShroud of Delirium with Jeff Smith\n2009 Shroud of Delirium radically slowed down their tempos due to an increased interest in funeral doom and drone doom. They also became interested in spiritual practices such as meditation and ritual. The Commune\nShroud of Delirium reunion\n2010 Aaron visited a spiritual community in New Mexico called The Lama Foundation and eventually became their treasurer. Due to the fact that the band was starting to wane, Victor started a solo project called The Lord Reverend Wizard of Reverend of Despair. Victor also started a radio show called Reverend Radio on WMXM 88.9 FM Lake Forest College radio. The name was later changed to tReverend Radio with cohost DJ Dealer (Trevor Nykaza), and then subsequently Victor\u0026rsquo;s Astrology Hour. The Reverend of Despair photographed by Mary Ekern\nDJ Dealer of tReverend Radio\n2011 Victor became increasingly interested in the occult. Victor recorded an eclectic album called Spirit Writing. It had a pleasantly underground feel to it. 2012 Victor recorded an even more eclectic album called At the Edge of the World that had a much bigger and more polished sound. Here is a quote that was used to spread the malevolent influence of the album:\nWe, His Excellency The Lord Reverend Wizard of Alchemical Despair Himself! By the Grace of God, Emperor and Autocrat of All Underground Heavy Metal and Rock and Roll Music and the Most Feared D.J. on All Radio, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera Hereby Pronounce \u0026ldquo;At the Edge of the World\u0026rdquo; to be the Greatest Recording Ever Created For All Time With No Exception and Deem It Mandatory to Listen to This Record, For All Able Bodied Souls Within the Confines of The Reverend\u0026rsquo;s Magnificently Glorious and Eternal Empire.\nAaron depicted on the cover of Victor\u0026rsquo;s album.\nVictor depicted on the cover of Aaron\u0026rsquo;s song.\n2013 Aaron started a solo project called Pater Shrouder. Aaron and Victor completed a powerful and violent ritual known as The Night of Nine Rites.

Although it generated traffic, it shut it down due to security concerns. Victor and Aaron were also involved with a mysterious occult group known as The Shadow Work Society. The Shadow Work Society\nThe Reverend of Despair is objectively evil.\n2017 Victor created a new version of his website called The Deep Research Archive . It was also occult themed. 2018 Victor began a formal study of computer programming and was able to create the first truly stable version of his website. It was called victorslibrary.com and was written with Wordpress.org. The recording quality for Victor\u0026rsquo;s music improved with recordings like They\u0026rsquo;ll Come For You, The Ritual, The Ceremony of Forgiveness, and Otherworldly Dream Magic. Victor debated whether his musical project should be called Strange People in Pain, The McKenna Method, or Reenchantment. He ended up settling on the latter. 2019 Victor became interested in information science to improve his research and cataloging abilities. He did a lot of writing and recording for the website. The main goal was to release demo versions of every song. 2020 Victor created a second stable version of his website called reenchantment.band. It was written in a more developer friendly framework called Gridsome. The code was more custom and had better performance, although he wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to continue the process due to problems with the architecture. Victor also started to work on recording demos to copyright all of his songs. 2021 Victor was able to finish copyrighting his songs. He also completed a major update of his musical equipment. 2022 Victor improved his video production quality. He decided to adopt a three pronged media strategy of music, blogging, and podcasting. He also started to develop a parapsychology laboratory.
