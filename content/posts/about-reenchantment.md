### Mystical Rock Music by Victor Fisher

Reenchantment is a rock and metal solo project by Victor Fisher. The name originates from Max Weber's theory of [disenchantment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenchantment). The goal of the project is to reenchant the world through the use of music or other spiritual practices. Please visit the [links page](/posts/reenchantment-links) for more information.
